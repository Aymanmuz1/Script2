This script checks for missing files in a Google Drive folder by comparing file names listed in a Google Sheet to those found in a specified Google Drive folder. If a file listed in the sheet is not found in the Drive folder, the corresponding row in the sheet is highlighted in yellow. Here's how the script works:

Reading the Google Sheet: The script first accesses the active Google Sheet and retrieves all the data in the sheet using getDataRange().getValues(). It assumes that the file names are in the first column.

Retrieving File Names from Google Drive:

The getFileNamesInDrive() function takes the sourceFolderId and retrieves all file names within that folder (and its subfolders) using the recursive helper function getAllFilesInFolder().
This function gathers all files from the folder and returns an array of file names.
Highlighting Missing Files:

The script loops through the file names in the sheet, and for each name, it checks whether the file is present in the Google Drive folder by searching the fileNamesInDrive array.
If a file name from the sheet is not found in the Drive folder, the corresponding row in the sheet is highlighted in yellow using setBackground('yellow').
Recursive File Retrieval: Similar to the previous code, the getAllFilesInFolder() function is used to ensure that all files, including those in subfolders, are retrieved and checked.

This script helps identify missing files by cross-referencing data between Google Sheets and Drive, highlighting any discrepancies in the sheet for easy review.
